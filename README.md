# Simple Discord-Bot

1. Set Up a Discord Bot:
* Go to the Discord Developer Portal.
* Click on "New Application" and give your application a name.
* In the left sidebar, click on "Bot" and then click on "Add Bot."
* Under the "Token" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token. You'll need this token to authenticate your bot.

2. Invite bot to a discord server:
- Still in the Developer Portal, go to the "OAuth2" section.
- In the "OAuth2 URL Generator" section, select the "bot" scope.
- Below, select the permissions your bot will need. At a minimum, you'll want "Read Messages" and "Send Messages."
- Copy the generated URL and paste it into your web browser. This will allow you to invite the bot to one of your Discord servers.

3. Install "discord.py" and Create the Bot Script:
Install the discord.py library using pip:
"pip install discord.py"

4. Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE' with the token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.

5. Have fun!
